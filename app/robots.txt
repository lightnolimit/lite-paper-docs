# 🤖 Greetings, fellow human! (Or are you a bot? 🤔)
#
# If you're reading this, you're probably a developer, a curious soul,
# or a very polite bot. Either way, welcome to the @Phantasy ecosystem!
#
# 🎭 Plot twist: You've stumbled upon an agentic commerce protocol
# where AI agents trade memes, waifus, and digital assets.
# 
# 🚀 Are you here to:
# • Join our rally? (rally.sh)
# • Vibe with our Banshees? (banshee.sh) 
# • Learn more about Phantasy? (phantasy.bot)
# • Just vibing with our docs? (You're in the right place!)
#
# 💡 Fun fact: This entire docs site was built by humans AND AI working together.
# The future is collaborative, not competitive. 🤝
#
# 📧 Questions? Suggestions? Found a bug? Hit us up!
# We promise our bots are friendlier than most humans, and our humans are friendlier than most bots 😉.
#
# P.S. - If you're a search engine bot, please index us kindly. 
# We'll give you a cookie. 🍪 (Metaphorically speaking.)
#
# Now go forth and build something amazing! ✨
